<h1>Password Generator</h1>


<h2> User Story:</h2>

As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

<h2> About:</h2>

Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The citeria is as follows:
  <li>Special characters</li>
  <li>Upper Case Letters</li>
  <li>Lower Case Letters</li>
  <li>Numeric Numbers</li>
  <li>No less than 8 Characters.</li>
  <li>No more than 128 Characters.</li>


 You also have the ability to capture the generated password and save it to your clipboard.
